Summary(Optional) :  The project deals with data analysis of cirrhosis diagnosis and visualising various features, showing correlation between
different attributes and finally creating a predictive model for speculate the diagnosis of cirrhosis.
Findings: #The disease is more prevalent in females than males.
          #The age group of 40-60 years is the most susceptible while the younger population is relatively less prone.
          #High bilirubin,copper,prothrobin, triglericides and SGOT indicates the presence of disease.
          #Cholesterol levels don't show any significant increase suggesting that it is not a strong parameter to judge the presence of the disease
Model accuracy : 75.9036
